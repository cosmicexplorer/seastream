seastream
=========

An attempt to produce a set of benchmarks for parsing algorithms. The name is reminiscent of the [eSTREAM benchmarks](https://cr.yp.to/streamciphers.html) from Daniel Bernstein and is intended to inspire similar competition to improve the state of the art. It also involves (TODO: will involve!) the use of parsers in a streaming context as one of the criteria.
